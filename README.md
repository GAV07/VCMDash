An DashBoard using outdated data from VCM

This was an old project of mine using shiny to create a dashboard to record different kinds of data that Venture Cafe was using to evaluate our performance. It was also a good way to practice launching data viz applications through Rconnect.

I have removed all of the old data for the sake of privacy.
