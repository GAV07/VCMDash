But what you may not know is that they share something important in common: they are all driven by a focus on great UX design! UX Design (short for User Experience Design) is the process of creating products that are built around the end-user’s needs. The idea is that if you create products that solve real pain points and are easy for customers to use, more customers will want to use them! During Ironhack's workshop at Venture Cafe, we'll teach you all the basic information you need to know about UX Design, and guide you through an exercise that puts your new learnings to the test! This workshop will be led by Maite Dalila, a UX Design Consultant with experience working on international projects for Mercedes, Regus, Tesco, Fortnum & Mason as well as many startups. Currently, she is a User Experience Designer at Kairos, a facial recognition start up, in Miami, FL.

Not sure if you should come? The principles behind UX design are applicable to any profession that works with people, or has people as the end consumer of a product or service. This means that anyone in marketing, business development, entrepreneurship, etc. (even doctors!) will leave with a valuable way of thinking to impact their approach to creating and providing.

4/9/2017 22:27:45,To Walk or Not to Walk in Miami: Where do you stand?,4/13/2017,"There’s an unofficial debate about the walkability of our Miami community, with reports in recent years ranking from “not so bad” #5 (out of ten, according to the Walk Score measurement system) to a “we could do better” #22 (out of thirty of the US’s largest metro areas, according to Smart Growth America). Meanwhile, as recent as January 2017 Miami ranked #11 in the list of America’s most dangerous cities for pedestrians, which is concerning no matter what way to you look at the issue. Renowned 1960s urban activist, Jane Jacobs, believed: “Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.” So the question remains, can the place we call home be considered a walkable city or not, and as everyday citizens what role do we play in determining the future of this status…? 

This Venture Cafe Miami session will give attendees an opportunity to: learn about the different characteristics of neighborhood design that make or break positive walking experiences; get acquainted and ultimately engaged with Jane's Walk, a global walking movement taking place the first weekend of May 2017 throughout greater Miami; plus they can play with ideas for free, citizen-led walking tours geared towards residents of all ages that would actively connect them with friends and neighbors, while getting to know each other and their city better.

It could be a business idea, but it could also be seeing the possibilities in the people that can help them grow that business. Entrepreneurship is all about embracing challenges. When you're building something from the ground up, you need to understand what your talents are and how you’re going to use them to create a business. Entrepreneurship is a lifestyle, in that being an entrepreneur is ingrained in one's identity. It’s the culmination of a certain set of characteristics: determination, creativity, the capacity to risk, leadership and enthusiasm. 
Being a successful entrepreneur requires a great deal of resourcefulness, because as an entrepreneur, you often run into dead ends throughout the course of your career. You need to be able to bounce back from losses if you want to be successful. Know that you will experience disappointment, but it’s imperative to stay optimistic when disappointment hits.
In this workshop, we will provide:  
•	The Characteristics of an Entrepreneur 
•	Evaluating your business ideas

Since these technologies are very novel and unique (that’s why they’re patented), the companies often create very novel and unique products/services from them.  Often, these products/services are better than anything else in the market or are capable of meeting needs that current products/services can’t meet.
 
-The products/services people have created from our patented technologies over the years are called NASA Spinoffs. However, many Spinoffs have come from other sources as well. Some Spinoffs were created based on NASA’s scientific research and others were created based on research or technology development work a company did for NASA.  There have been about 1800 Spinoffs since NASA was founded and collectively they have significantly contributed to the U.S. economy.  You can learn more about NASA Spinoffs at this site: http://spinoff.nasa.gov/. And this one: http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/nasacity/index2.htm.
 
- We currently have over 1000 patented technologies available for transfer to the U.S. public through the NASA T2 Program.  Many we hope will eventually be used to create NASA Spinoffs of the future.

Social networks have clusters of happy and unhappy people within them that reach out to three degrees of separation. A person's happiness is related to the happiness of their friends, their friends' friends, and their friends' friends' friends--that is, to people well beyond their social horizon. We found that happy people tend to be located in the center of their social networks and to be located in large clusters of other happy people. And we found that each additional happy friend increases a person's probability of being happy by about 9%.

1/5/2017 5:44:18, Title: Heroine’s Journey Part II: Boldly Stepping into Leadership,1/19/2017,"The Heroine’s Journey is a globally delivered experiential workshop that helps us re-frame how we live our individual and collective narratives through timeless and feminine-centered journey of personal growth. In the Fall we conducted Part I  - Authentically Manifesting our Sacred Feminine, we talked about the different stages of the Heroine's Journey.  We are returning to Venture Cafe with Part II of the Heroine's Journey. 

In this follow up workshop in the Heroine's Leadership Series, We utilize a woman-centered leadership development approach to energize women to re-frame their experiences through the deconstruction of heroine archetypes that embrace the changes that we must go through within ourselves to become powerful and authentic leaders. This will be a highly interactive session.  Now more than ever, women are called to step into leadership more authentically. We can no longer afford to stand back and wait for others to step up - it is our responsibility to step into leadership and to do Power Differently!  

This event calls on women to step up more boldly to take on leadership roles in every aspect of society.

12/7/2016 18:55:42,"CourtVision International Presents: ""Raising Global IQ for Generational Competency""",1/19/2017,"As people live longer and technology improves, societal barriers between generations are slowly changing and, in some cases, completely evaporating. Changes in the workplace, like the multitude of today's workers delaying retirement, have caused some companies to have as many as four generations working on the same assignments, bringing with them their generalized sets of shared experiences and distinct motivations. 

Like national cultures, generations are cultures too, and, when mixed, they often create conflict and frustration. Look no further than social media during this past election season. When social media first surfaced, it was dominated by younger generations and was based on self-expression and lifestyle. With the recent increase of Baby Boomers using sites like Facebook, these social media forms have completely transformed and, at times like the election, exploded as generational cultures clash over their differences in this common space. 

But is all this clashing constructive? Are we getting the most out of what each generation brings to the table? If not, who is getting left behind? 

Much discussion has centered around the navigation of cultures and worldview in organizational or even interstate conflict. Conflict practitioners and human resource professionals have developed best practices on the way in which to improve society through the inclusion of diverse perspectives on important topics and key disputes. 

Can we harness the cultural distinctions between generations in the same way? How can we promote constructive conflict between multiple generations that fosters an atmosphere of growth and cooperative progress? CourtVision International is a non-profit organization that works in multiple cultural contexts all over the globe. 

The mission of the organization is to use sports to promote a two-way dialogue in which:

-youth develop the keys for success in a world orchestrated by adults, while at the same time
-adults are encouraged to listen to the voice of youth on the affairs impacting their community (and their youth).

CourtVision believes this two-way dialogue is the key to maximizing the potential of our society. Come hear about the lessons we have learned about focusing on this dialogue and the development of Global IQ in our work in Sport For Development and Peace!",CourtVision International Inc. ,Wes Bugg,gwbugg@courtvisioninternational.com,Emailed,@courtvisionint,@courtvisioninternational,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/courtvision-international-presents-raising-global-iq-for-generational-competency-tickets-30106197447,7:00:00 PM,8:00:00 PM,60 mins,Altamira (15+ Roundtable Set-up),Tatiana,Male,We have multi-cultural presentation team.,LEARN,Education,No,,Human Capital & Organizational Culture,"Economic  & Educational Equity, Urban Mobility, Civic Participation",,

Presentation Title:
Nature’s Inventions and Industrial Innovations
An Introduction to the Principles and Methods of Bionics and Biomimicry

Presentation Description:
Life has been performing design experiments for 3.8 billion years and the best ideas on the planet today are those that perform well while economizing on energy and materials.

Whatever a company’s design challenge, the odds are high that one or more of the world’s 30 million living creatures have not only faced the same challenge, but have evolved effective strategies to solve it, thriving. This workshop will explores how bionics and biodesign have been critical to Franco Lodato’s trend-setting products. Strategies can range from the mimicry of nature to conceptual abstractions. In one of his projects, a woodpecker provoked a fresh look at the design of an ice axe. In another, the exterior shells of lobsters and other crustaceans suggested a layered polymer design for the coverings of rugged cell phones.

About Franco Lodato:

About the book – The Laughing Guide to Well-Being

Do you experience stress? Are you interested in better health and well-being? Do you pursue happiness? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you need to read this book. If you answered no, you’re in denial. All of us can use a little help to become happier or healthier. Unfortunately, the help we get is often too scary: “if you don’t do this or that, some catastrophic event of epic proportions will happen.” Prilleltensky’s approach, in contrast, is to help you become healthier and happier through laughter. In this hilarious book, Prilleltensky combines humor with science to help you improve your well-being. Each chapter consists of the Laughing Side, a series of funny stories; and the Learning Side, a research-based, user-friendly guide to health and happiness. The first chapter provides an overview of well-being, while subsequent chapters cover each of its six domains: Interpersonal, Community, Occupational, Physical, Psychological, and Economic (I COPPE). When you finish the book you’ll have a greater understanding of your life, and ways to make it better.",FuckUp Nights Miami,Carl Hildebrand,carl@miamicollegeofdesign.com,I will email FuckUp Night Miami and Comic Cure,#fuckupnightsmiami,#fuckupnightsmiami,,6:30:00 PM,8:30:00 PM,60 mins,Deering/ Tuttle (60 - Classroom Set-up),Tatiana,Male,Eastern European,PLAY,Professional Services,,,,,,

• Connecting a news organization’s ethics guidelines with product design.

• Maintaining a focus on fundamental theories of human behavior and connection to reach future audiences.

Focused on your mission and what it takes to make it happen, ""Leader of the New Schools"" was created by millennials for millennials with the knowledge that most work is done through the help of a team, but when you are a freelancer, running a small business, or thinking about starting a business, you do not always have the resources, time or manpower to build the successful business you’re willing to work for. Leader of the New Schools was designed to help you think through ideas, create a road map to grow or sustain your business and implement the best strategies you need to execute your big (and small) plans. The 6 workshops and topics includes a sit down Q/A with a business attorney, the steps it takes to becoming a b-corp in the State of Florida, how to determine your company’s higher purpose and what it means for the community, how to sell when you don’t want to sell, how to communicate your mission to a large audience without selling out and how to invest and what investors are interested in.

View-Through is a community-based initiative in the Miami area to adjust online search platforms to more prominently feature poetry written by incarcerated individuals. Our project utilizes synchronized, strategic internet searching to alter search predictions (the type-ahead suggestions that appear on sites such as Google). These predictions are generated by algorithms and are based in large part on search volume within a geographic region.

We are asking South Florida residents to search for the following six poems: which will be published on the websites of 25 partner organizations. 

Miami inmates are sunbathing underwater
Miami inmates are what becomes of the chicken before I fry it up
Miami inmates are a device used to tell time
Miami inmates are light of the world, bone of men
Miami inmates are items of furniture for frightened people to lie down and rest upon
Miami inmates are believing in the unseen

This action will create a search trend, resulting in a monopoly on local search predictions for “Miami inmate”.","O, Miami ",Micheal Martin ,banyanroots@gmail.com ,https://www.dropbox.com/s/955utxa8gbhj6mc/O%2CMiami-KnightFoundation-Logo-2.png?dl=0,@omiamifestival,@omiamifestival,,6:30:00 PM,7:30:00 PM,45 mins,InfoTable,Liza,Male,Hispanic or Latino,ENGAGE,Arts & Creative Design,No,,Marketing & Branding,Civic Participation,,No

When the primary technologies you’re building upon and deploying are changing at a breakneck pace, the primitives of understanding and managing those technologies need to evolve as well. This is why DevOps practices, and automation frameworks, that emphasize cycle time, iterations, and common abstraction have become so valuable. Whether you’re deploying a war file to a J2EE application server, or thousands of containers to kubernetes, the actions you need to take are similar. You have testing, deployment, infrastructure creation, management, compliance, security and event management. In this discussion, I’ll cover keeping up with changing technologies by applying conceptual abstractions that map across generations of technology tooling. I’ll also provide concrete examples of how using devops methodologies allows your organization to get more done, all backed by data.

Women are evolving. Every woman does not wear pink, dream of marriage, two kids, and a dog anymore; so just like Dell, many companies have attempted to corner the women’s market but failed, however many small businesses are not attempting at all, therefore missing out on a grand opporuntity. This failure comes from a lack of understanding around how a company gets a woman to know, LOVE, and trust the brand, while translating that love into revenue. In this interactive session we will cover the do’s and don’t’s of marketing to women, discuss marketing trends, and simultaneously create an outline and strategy that your company or organization can use to start building and growing with the women’s movement instead of against it.

Starting Thursday, June 29th, international ""Chia Ortegon Art Collection: Water Goddesses"" will be showcased on the 6th floor of the vibrant Cambridge Innovation Center Miami, a one-of-a-kind co-working office initiative. 

We will have an unveiling of the art happening at exactly 6:30PM, then right after we will have a special talk with ""Alchemical Artista"" Chia Ortegon about the process of her artwork at 7PM in the ALTAMIRA conference room. Prepare to open up your hearts to new possibilities in experience!

About the artist:

With over 20 years of experience, Chia Ortegon has brought the community hundreds of impressive artworks, dozens of exhibitions in the US and around the world, and unique pop-up art performances. After a year-old adventure to find her home, Chia returned to Miami, realizing it was her place to be all along. Now Chia is dedicating her time, experience, and wisdom to uplift the young emerging artists of The Waking Hearts and beyond.

About the artwork and talk:

This exhibition is dedicated to the DIVINE FEMININE and PROTECTION OF WATER, and it explores the notions of the consciousness of water and how the feminine flows into a mysterious dance of color and emotion. Done with acrylics but treated as watercolors, this collection showcases a one-of-a-kind rendition to the aspects that empower the female form. Come to this talk to learn more about her process, in which she secluded herself for a year making these masterful artworks.

Dockless bike share platform LimeBike is not immune to such categorization, except that it's taken a very unique approach in how it works closely with local government and community to develop a seamless, eco-friendly, and fun way to get around town. Unlike other bike-sharing systems which require users to return bikes to a docking station, LimeBike riders can essentially leave their bikes anywhere among public areas, such as bike racks, parks and sidewalks.

The Silicon Valley-based, Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup recently launched operations in nearby Key Biscayne just over a month ago. LimeBike's first ever municipal market has seen impressive ridership through a combination of active community engagement, fun promotions and events, and most importantly, the roll out of a fully-customized infrastructure with the support of local government, private businesses, and the media.

Yuki Lin has been tasked to jumpstart local operations in Key Biscayne while building out a fully local staff. He will be highlighting some of the exciting growth opportunities LimeBike has already experienced in its first month, while also dissecting some of the inherent challenges when suddenly launching a very visible and rapidly-growing technology service. Previous to LimeBike, Yuki worked for the Obama Administration, Uber in Japan, and most recently at Airbnb managing their grassroots fight for the preservation of short-term rentals in San Francisco.",LimeBike,Yuki Lin,yuki.lin@limebike.com,Will email,@limebike,@limebike,"Yes please, if not too much trouble!",7:30:00 PM,8:30:00 PM,60 mins,Amazon Room,Liza,Male,Asian/ Pacific Islander,LEARN​,Technology,No,,Business Models & Impact Measurement,Urban Mobility,,No

It accounts for 25% of the world’s wealth, and is the home to some 540 Billionaires and 10 million Millionaires. Yet, 80% of Americans are struggling financially, with nearly 69% having less than $1000 in savings and only 4% of Americans attaining financial independence or able to retire. My mission is to encourage and empower people to surpass their potential in their fearless pursuit of happiness, entrepreneurship, and financial success.
This workshop will discuss the use of financial and business strategies to: 

-Identify and Overcome Emotional and Financial Habits that Limit the Poor and Middle Class
-Identify and Copy the Financial Habits that Empower the Rich
-Identify the Hundreds of Tax Deductions You’re Entitled To Use
-Invest Your Time And Labor To Build Wealth In The Same Manner As You Do Your Money
-Identify And Use Tools Which Level The Playing Field For The Poor And Middle Class

Theses strategies are vital for Smart Cashflow Management to close the economic gap between the Poor/Middle Class and the Rich.

The AI event is on October 18th, 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM.  

After billions of dollars and decades of research, we are entering a new era of robotics and conscious artificial intelligence. A.I. is poised to transform our society as did the internet years ago. We are already using A.I. when we use speech recognition software, Google Translate, and many other apps and services. Nearly all of the largest software and social media companies are working towards integrating some form of A.I. into their product and service, including Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft. Today, we have Robotic helpers, driverless cars, problem solving A.Is, and we're just getting started. Machine Intelligence has the potential to usher in a new age of technology like we've never seen before that will have a tremendous impact on job markets, the economy, and our every day lives.

In this discussion we'll look at the technological changes that are sweeping through our world and the future effects that A.I can have on our economy and our personal lives. The good and also the dangers of A.I. that we'll need to face. Join us for a deep learning discussion and ask yourself: Are you ready for this new era of machine intelligence?

Miami is usually typecast as a superficial city, but this project aims to bring forth a deeper aspect of our collective emotional story by uniting Miamians in a shared moment of release, communal grief, remembrance, recognition, and joy.
